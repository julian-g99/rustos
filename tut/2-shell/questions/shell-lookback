My implementation uses the StackVec data structure to save input bytes from the user as they type, as well as storing the different parts of a command. It uses the global Console lock to write to the console. It uses uart functionliaties through Console to read and write bytes. Since we are using uart, this also inherently uses the GPIO drivers. I've also set up a timer so that the shell starts after one second.
