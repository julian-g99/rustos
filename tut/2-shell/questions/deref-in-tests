The tests that will fail are index_obb, index_obb_after_truncate, indexing, mut_indexing, iterator. Similarly, any method above that needs to mutate will not work if we only implement Deref. These method fails because they call methods that are defined for the slice type but not for our StackVec. The compiler knows to deref automatically if it cannot find the methods in StackVec, but only if we implement the trait.
