Consider a cbz instruction as the following:
    cbz x0, label

It will compar ethe value in x0 with the immediate #0, and jump to label if they're equal. Consider this sequence of instructions:
    mov x1, 0
    cmp x0, x1
    b label

Other than the fact that cbz is shorter, it also does not change the condition flags.
